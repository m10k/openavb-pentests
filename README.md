# openavb-pentests - Tools for testing OpenAVB security

This repository is a collection of tools used for pentesting
the OpenAVB stack. Software in this repository is meant to
support a security audit that I am currently conducting, which
means that not all of the tools can actually be used to attack
any of the OpenAVB components.


## Protocol fuzzing

Any fuzzing-related code is located in the *scapy/* directory,
which contains both protocol implementations for the scapy
framework, as well as scripts to launch fuzz-tests of these
protocols.


## Vulnerabilities and exploits

The *exploits/* directory contains tools that are either used
to exploit specific vulnerabilities detected in the software
stack, or to explore the behavior of OpenAVB components when
confronted with certain situations. Therefore, not all of the
tools contained within are actual exploits. In the future,
such reconnaissance tools will be stored separately.
